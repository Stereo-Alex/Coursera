Assumptions Consistency
One Population Proportion
Sample can be considered a simple random sample

Large enough sample size ()

Confidence Interval: At least 10 of each outcome ()
Hypothesis Test: At least 10 of each outcome ()
Two Population Proportions
Samples can be considered two simple random samples

Samples can be considered independent of one another

Large enough sample sizes ()

Confidence Interval: At least 10 of each outcome ()
Hypothesis Test: At least 10 of each outcome () - Where (the common population proportion estimate)
One Population Mean
Sample can be considered a simple random sample

Sample comes from a normally distributed population

This assumption is less critical with a large enough sample size (application of the C.L.T.)
One Population Mean Difference
Sample of differences can be considered a simple random sample

Sample of differences comes from a normally distributed population of differences

This assumption is less critical with a large enough sample size (application of the C.L.T.)
Two Population Means
Samples can be considered a simple random samples

Samples can be considered independent of one another

Samples each come from normally distributed populations

This assumption is less critical with a large enough sample size (application of the C.L.T.)
Populations have equal variances – pooled procedure used

 If this assumption cannot be made, unpooled procedure used
